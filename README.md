- C# Programming Fundamentals üöÄ

Welcome to my C# Programming Fundamentals repository! üëã This collection features practical exercises designed to explore and solidify my understanding of the C# language. It's a great place to see my foundational work in C#, focusing on core syntax and essential programming concepts.

Course Context & Repository Structure üìö
This repository contains the starter code for many different projects from the worldwide content version of CSE 210. These projects are arranged as follows:

sandbox - An empty project you can use to experiment with any concepts you like.
csharp-prep - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments.
prepare - Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities.
prove - Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects.
final - Starter projects for the final project.
Repository Goal üéØ
The main purpose of csharp-fundamentals is to:

Master C# Syntax: Practice basic language structures, data types, operators, and control flow.
Understand Functions/Methods: Implement reusable logic through methods.
Explore Classes & Objects: Get familiar with creating and using classes, a key aspect of C#.
Grasp OOP Basics: Introduce core Object-Oriented Programming principles like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, demonstrating how C# supports these concepts.
Reinforce Programming Principles: Apply fundamental programming ideas within the C# environment.
Repository Content üìÅ
This repository is organized into various exercises, each illustrating a specific C# concept. You'll find:

Examples of basic classes and object interaction.
Illustrations of inheritance and how subclasses extend behavior.
Demonstrations of polymorphism through method overriding.
Exercises on encapsulation using access modifiers (public, private).
Practices with functions/methods for diverse operations.
Other programming fundamentals adapted to C# syntax.
Technologies Used üíª
C#: The primary programming language.
.NET Framework / .NET Core: The runtime environment used to build and execute C# applications.
Visual Studio / VS Code: Common development environments for C#.
